## Audit

```bash
openclawcn security audit
openclawcn security audit --deep
openclawcn security audit --fix
```

The audit warns when multiple DM senders share the main session and recommends `session.dmScope="per-channel-peer"` for shared inboxes.
It also warns when small models (`<=300B`) are used without sandboxing and with web/browser tools enabled.
